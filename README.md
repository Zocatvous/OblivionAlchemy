This is my attempt at creating a fun discord bot with the ability to craft potions similiar to the system in the Bethesda Videogame Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

I love that potioncrafting system and I want to bring it wherever I go. 

Currently this bot is being hosted through Heroku and all of its CI/CD is done there. I am not currently planning on rolling it out en-masse until I have the ability to be
sure that it will pay for itself without any issues regarding monetization. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
